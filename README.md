# Advent of Code Solutions

Welcome to my Advent of Code solutions! ðŸŽ„

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code puzzles, written in Go (Golang). Every day, a new challenge is released, and I try to solve it using clean, efficient code while learning new things along the way.

## About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual event where participants solve daily coding puzzles during the month of December. The puzzles range from simple logic problems to more complex algorithmic challenges. Each day presents a new set of problems, and the solutions often get progressively harder.

## My Approach

- **Language:** Go (Golang)
- **Style:** I aim for clean, readable, and efficient code while solving the problems. Each day's solution is contained in its own folder for easy navigation.
- **Commit Frequency:** I commit solutions daily, typically after solving both parts of the problem.

## Structure of the Repository

Each day's challenge is organized into its own directory:
- **20xx**: Contains the solutions for Advent of Code 20XX.
- **DayXX**: Contains the solutions for Day XX of Advent of Code 20XX.
- **main.go**: Solution for the first&second part of the puzzle.

## Running the Code

To run any solution, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Go installed. You can download it from the official [Go website](https://golang.org/dl/).
2. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MichaelCTH/AdventOfCode.git
    cd AdventOfCode
    ```
3. Navigate to the specific dayâ€™s folder and run the solution. For example:
    ```bash
    cd 2024/Day1
    go run main.go
    ```
